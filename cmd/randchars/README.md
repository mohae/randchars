randchars
=========

randchars is a cli app that generates random characters. By default, it generates them from the `base64` set and outputs the resulting characters to `stdout`; one line per group of generated character. A PRNG is used unless the `-c` flag is passed, which will result in a CSPRNG being used.

## Usage 

    $ randchars 12
	BtpzuxNAcgCN
	1 sets totalling 12 random characters were generated and written to stdout

Multiple groups of random characters can be generated by providing a space separated list of numbers.

    $ randchars 12 12 12
    Yqh/Hc/1e7iF
	0qpUX+cgi7no
	ttDN5dIIUalq
	3 sets totalling 36 random characters were generated and written to stdout

Use a CSPRNG:

   $ randchars -c 16
   AG2KBlizOPm+DTZf
   1 sets totalling 16 random characters were generated and written to stdout
